# Computer-Vision-Project
This project leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and classify human facial emotions in real-time. Built using Python, it employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze facial expressions captured via a webcam or from static images. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset containing a wide range of facial expressions representing different emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more. The application utilizes libraries such as OpenCV for image processing, TensorFlow/Keras for building and training the neural network, and dlib for facial landmark detection. The result is an efficient, accurate system capable of recognizing and interpreting human emotions, with potential applications in fields such as human-computer interaction, customer service, and psychological research.
